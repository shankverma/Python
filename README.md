### 2. Unit Tests
- **File:** `sort_test.py`
  - Contains unit tests for sorting and searching algorithms, JSON serialization/deserialization, and regex pattern matching.
  - Test classes include:
    - `TestSortSearchAlgorithms`: Tests for sorting and searching algorithms.
    - `TestJsonSerializer`: Tests for JSON serialization and deserialization.
    - `TestRegex`: Tests for regex pattern matching.

### 3. Data Analysis
- **File:** `corona_analysis.ipynb`
  - A Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data related to COVID-19.
  - Includes ranking and plotting functionalities.
